## Mechanism of Burst

Burst is a unique platform that leverages the inherent structure of social circles as a multi-layered filtering mechanism to establish a high-quality platform.

## How It Works:

1. Start by Creating a New Post: With Burst, users can create new posts with ease.
2. Initial Visibility: When a post is created, it's initially visible only to the user's 10x closest group of people, ensuring a safe and trustworthy environment for posters.
3. Boosting a Post: If someone within this close circle finds the post worth sharing, they can boost it.
4. Estimation Model: The platform runs the boosts through an estimation model to predict how the rest of the circle will react to the post.
5. Reaching the Burst Threshold: If the post receives enough boosts and positive reactions, it reaches the "Burst" threshold.
6. Unlocking the Next Layer: Once the threshold is achieved, the next layer of 100x is unlocked, making the post visible to a broader audience.
7. Feedback Loop: The post starts appearing in more people's feeds, and the boosting process runs again. If the post isn't well-received in the broader 100x group, it remains at that level and won't burst further.

## Benefits:

-   High-Quality Content: By utilizing the multi-layered filtering mechanism, Burst ensures that only quality content reaches a broader audience.
-   Safe Environment: Burst provides a safe and trustworthy environment for posters, ensuring that their content is initially shared with a close circle before reaching a wider audience.
