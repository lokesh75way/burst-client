                        DESCRIPTION: You are invited to participate in a
                        research study on the design of social media platforms.
                        You will be asked to use this social media platform as
                        per your interests and desires.{"\n"}
                    </Text>
                    <Text>
                        TIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation will take as little
                        or as much time as you choose to spend on this platform.{" "}

                        RISKS AND BENEFITS: While we strive to create lower
                        risks with this project, the risks associated with this
                        study are similar in nature to those using other social
                        media. The platform will collect data required for its
                        operation and for analysis in scientific publications,
                        including the content that you share, the people or
                        groups that you are conntected to, and your reactions to
                        content on the platform. Study data will be stored
                        securely, in compliance with Stanford University
                        standards, minimizing the risk of confidentiality
                        breach. The benefits which may reasonably be expected to
                        result from this study are similar in nature to using
                        other social media. We cannot and do not guarantee or
                        promise that you will receive any benefits from this
                        study.{"\n"}

                        AGE: In accordance with United States COPPA rules, you
                        may only use this platform if you are 13 years of age or
                        older.{"\n"}

                        PARTICIPANTâ€™S RIGHTS: If you have read this form and

                        understand your participation is voluntary and you have
                        the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue
                        participation at any time without penalty or loss of
                        benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The
                        alternative is not to use this platform. You have the
                        right to refuse to answer particular questions. The
                        results of this research study may be presented at
                        scientific or professional meetings or published in
                        scientific journals. Your individual privacy will be
                        maintained in all published and written data resulting
                        from the study.{"\n"}
